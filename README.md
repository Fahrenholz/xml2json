xml2json
========

I made this simple XML to JSON parser for nodeJs for test purposes. It is yet working, but won't be the tool of your choice if you have something more complicated to do

# Installing

to use it, you must install it via npm
```bash
  npm install xml2json
```
after that, simply require it:

```javascript
  xml2json = require('xml2json');
```

# API

## parseFile(path)

allows you to parse an xml file to a JSON object

## parseString (string)

allows you to parse an xml string to a JSON object

# Todo

better testing and implementing functionality
